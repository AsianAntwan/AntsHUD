I want to apologize for the longest update drought this HUD has ever received when it went out of Beta.
I never anticapted it to be this long. Quite frankly, making it out of Beta made me lazy. I'll try to swtich
up on how I update AntsHUD to keep me motivated. With life stuff piling in, I just want to prioritize those
more than this. Another factor would be that I'm starting to lose interest in TF2. Believe me, it's been the best game
I've played in a long time. However, TF2 has been in the same update drought position and creating the
same feeling as like AntsHUD has been. While I'm not one to be in a hurry or anything, I start noticing
the issues with Valve more than I wanted to. That's a good thing. I'm glad the community is taking stand
for this instead of letting it slide. It's been the first time I've seen this community florish into
something grand. For that, all I have to say is...

Thanks,
Antwan

P.S. Thanks Whisker, Creator of budhud, mastercomms for the Health Status animation bug fix, and you guys for helping me in some form. Grand or little.
